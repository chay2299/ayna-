# ðŸŽ¨ Polygon Coloring with Conditional UNet

This project is developed as part of the **Ayna AI ML Internship Assignment**. It trains a UNet model from scratch to color polygon shapes based on a text input color.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given:
- An input grayscale image of a polygon (e.g., triangle, square, octagon)
- A text label representing a color (e.g., "red", "blue", "yellow")

> Goal:
Generate a colored version of the input polygon where the fill color matches the given label.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

Ensure your dataset is organized as follows after extraction:

```
dataset/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ training/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input_image.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ output_image.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ validation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ input_image.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ output_image.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ sample.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each `.json` file contains:
```json
{
  "input": "input_image.png",
  "output": "output_image.png",
  "color": "blue"
}
```

## ðŸ›  Model Architecture

A custom-built **UNet** is used with an added one-hot encoded vector representing the color. The input to the model has shape:
```
[Batch, 1 (input image) + N (color one-hot), 128, 128]
```
The output is:
```
[Batch, 3 (RGB), 128, 128]
```

## ðŸš€ Training

### Steps:

1.  Load and preprocess dataset (input, output, color label)
2.  One-hot encode color (e.g., "red" â†’ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])
3.  Concatenate input image and color encoding as input to the model
4.  Train UNet using MSE loss or SmoothL1 loss
5.  Evaluate on validation data

Training is logged using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

---

##  Inference

You can generate output polygon images using:
- A polygon input image
- A text label (e.g., "green")

The model will generate the polygon filled with the correct color.

## ðŸ“ˆ Weights & Biases

All training metrics (loss curves, predictions) are logged using [W&B](https://wandb.ai/).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

-  Python
-  PyTorch
-  Weights & Biases (wandb)
-  Pillow, Matplotlib
-  Google Colab / Kaggle
